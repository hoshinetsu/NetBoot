# The NetBoot Project
An app **dedicated for my friend**, so that she could remotely switch on my PC. For what, you might ask? For science, let's say 😸 

There's not too much stuff going on in here, as it was intended to be used by a non-technical person, which doesn't care about how much power is the PC drawing, for example ;) Although, thanks to smart plug integration it totally could be added in here. Meant to be accessible, fast and simple, and most importantly **functional**.

 - Includes custom basic authentication in PHP backend.
 - Integrates with a Shelly smart plug and industry standard, magic packet Wake-on-LAN - windows binary included, could be easily changed to linux, just edit the command in php script.
 - Frontend made with vanilla JavaScript & Bootstrap. Looks decent on mobile - somewhat responsive!
